# health-bar

A small prototype that tested out a Health Bar draining mechanic. This would eventually be implemented in another game of mine- Mind Cleaning.

This mechanic is inspired by the torture sequence that's in Metal Gear Solid.

This prototype contains the following:

- A Health Bar that is constantly draining
- A Gameplay Mechanic where mashing the space bar would refill slightly
- Various levels of intensity
