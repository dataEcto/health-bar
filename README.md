# health-bar
Part of my personal Summer Game Making Marathon (TM of course). A game where you have to recover your health by spamming that space bar.

WHAT IS THE SUMMER GAME MAKING MARATHON?
Recently, I have finally gotten into creating games within Unity. It's a very fun process, but I also noticed that I can get
very ambitous. I tend to want to work on ideas that can't really be handled by one person alone, and during my Game Development class, I end up not having a lot of time left to work on what I wanted to work in. Plus, I'm also a perfectionist so I sometimes just don't want to show my work at all. I want to change that!

Over my Summer break, I want to see how many small games I can create, and see what the results are. These Repos will be a in progress look at my work.


HEALTH BAR GAME (Name in Progress)
5/28/18
I decided to create a game that is based off on that scene in various Metal Gear games where Snake gets tortued, and the player must mash a button to keep his health bar up while his health bar drains. It's not the most super impressive game over, but hey it's simple.
When I created my first few games back in my Game Dev class, I realized how much I go inbetween implementing certain mechanics in them.
For example, the Sneaking Game I made had a lot of focus on the GUARD AI and not much else. I decided to see what I can do if I focus on ONE Mechanic on the game, which is this Health Bar going down and getting refilled.
